PDE X
=====

PDE X is a [Processing](http://processing.org/) Mode that brings powerful new features to the Processing Development Environment: 

* Intelligent Code Completion
* Quick Renaming(Refactoring)
* Quick Navigation
* Import Suggestions
* Live Error Checker
* Integrated Debugger 
* Integrated TweakMode

Find out more at [Getting Started](https://github.com/processing/processing-experimental/wiki/Getting-Started). Or checkout the [FAQ](https://github.com/processing/processing-experimental/wiki/FAQ)

PDE X was originally developed in its own [processing-experimental](https://github.com/processing/processing-experimental) repo, but has now been moved into the main processing code base. PDE X has been set as the default startup mode. (Java Mode still exists, though no longer the default mode)
