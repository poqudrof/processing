PDE X v1.0.4b - May 9, 2014

Requires Processing 2.1.2 or above.

Bug fixes

+ Disabled auto-save. My sincere apologies to those who lost data due
to this bug. It was wrong of me to release an untested feature without
adding an option to enable/disable it. I've learnt a lesson and I shall
ensure this sort of thing doesn't happen again in the future.

+ Autocompletion bug, column is sometimes off by 1
